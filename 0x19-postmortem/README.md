# Incident Summary:

## Outage Duration:

The service disruption occurred from 10:00 to 12:00 local time.

## Impact:

The primary service, responsible for processing incoming requests, experienced sluggish performance, leading to delays in addressing user requests. Approximately 30% of users were affected.

## Root Cause:

A critical bug within the code triggered a memory leak, depleting available resources and causing a slowdown in service operations.

## Timeline:

- 10:25:
  The issue was identified through performance monitoring.

- 10:30:
  Engineers initiated an investigation, initially suspecting a potential server load issue.

- 11:00:
  Examination of logs and performance metrics revealed a memory leak as the culprit for the slowdown.

- 11:15:
  The problem was reported to the development team for further analysis and resolution.

- 12:05:
  Developers successfully identified and rectified the root cause, restoring the service to normal functionality.

## Root Cause and Solution:

The underlying problem stemmed from a code-related memory leak. The solution involved addressing and rectifying the coding error, coupled with resource optimization measures.
